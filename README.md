## Tech Stack

- **Next.js:** Next.js is a popular framework for building React applications. It provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and other performance optimizations out of the box. Next.js simplifies the development of React-based applications by offering features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and routing.
- **Chakra UI:** Chakra UI is a component library and design system for React applications. It offers a set of customizable and accessible UI components that can be used to create modern and responsive user interfaces. Chakra UI's focus on design system principles allows for consistent and flexible UI design across the entire application.
- **React:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of the application. React's component-based architecture promotes modular and maintainable code.
- **Axios:** Axios is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js. It simplifies the process of fetching data from APIs and handling response data.
- **SWR:** SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) is a React hook library for data fetching. It provides a simple way to manage remote data with client-side caching and automatic revalidation, ensuring that data is always up to date and reducing unnecessary network requests.
- **lodash:** Lodash is a utility library that provides a collection of helper functions for JavaScript. It offers a wide range of utility functions to simplify common tasks like array manipulation, object operations, and more.
- **currency-flags:** Currency Flags is a library that provides SVG flags for different currencies. It allows the app to display the flags of different currencies alongside their respective codes or names.
- **react-select:** React Select is a flexible and customizable dropdown select component for React applications. It allows users to choose options from a list and is widely used in forms and data selection scenarios.
